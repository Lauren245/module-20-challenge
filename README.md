## Description
This application is a quiz platform focused on Python programming. It features a client-side application developed using React and TypeScript, and a server-side application built with Node.js and Express. The application allows users to take a quiz consisting of 10 randomly selected questions from a database, view their scores, and restart the quiz upon completion.

The project is configured with a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, ensuring that all code changes are automatically tested and deployed. Cypress is used for component testing in this application

Key features of the application include:
- A responsive and interactive user interface for taking Python quizzes.
- A backend API for managing quiz data and user interactions.
- Automated testing and deployment workflows to maintain code quality and streamline the development process.
- Detailed test reports generated by Cypress.

This project serves as a practical example of integrating various tools and technologies to create a full-stack web application with continuous integration and deployment capabilities.


## Installation

**Note: The app does not need to be installed unless you wish to run the app locally on your machine. To just use the app go to https://module-20-challenge-awmp.onrender.com** 

To set up and run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Lauren245/module-20-challenge.git
    cd mod-20-challenge
    ```

2. **Install server dependencies**:
    ```sh
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install client dependencies**:
    ```sh
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the necessary environment variables. For example:
        ```env
        MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
        ```

5. **Build the server**:
    ```sh
    cd ../server
    npm run build
    ```

6. **Seed the database** (optional):
    ```sh
    npm run seed
    ```

7. **Start the server**:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

8. **Start the client**:
    ```sh
    cd ../client
    npm start
    ```

The application should now be running locally. You can access the client application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000` and the server API at `http://localhost:3001`.


## Usage

Once you have the application running locally or have accessed the deployed version, you can use the application as follows:

1. **Access the Quiz**:
    - Open your web browser and navigate to the client application at `http://localhost:3000` if running locally, or the deployed version URL.

2. **Start the Quiz**:
    - On the homepage, you will see a button labeled "Start Quiz". Click this button to begin the quiz.

3. **Answer Questions**:
    - The quiz consists of 10 randomly selected questions from the database. Each question will be displayed one at a time.
    - Select the answer you believe is correct for each question and click the "Next" button to proceed to the next question.

4. **View Your Score**:
    - After answering all 10 questions, your score will be displayed. You will see the number of questions you answered correctly out of 10.

5. **Restart the Quiz**:
    - If you wish to take the quiz again, click the "Restart Quiz" button to start a new quiz with a different set of randomly selected questions.

6. **Explore the Code**:
    - If you are interested in exploring the codebase, you can navigate through the client and server directories to understand how the application is built and how different components interact.

These steps should help you effectively use the quiz application and understand its functionality.

## Tests

This application uses Cypress for end-to-end testing to ensure the functionality of the quiz platform. The tests are configured to run automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

### Running Tests Locally

To run the tests locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Cypress**:
    If you haven't already installed Cypress, you can do so by running:
    ```sh
    npm install cypress --save-dev
    ```

2. **Open Cypress Test Runner**:
    ```sh
    npx cypress open
    ```
    This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can run the tests interactively.

3. **Run Tests in Headless Mode**:
    To run the tests in headless mode (useful for CI/CD pipelines), use the following command:
    ```sh
    npx cypress run
    ```

### CI/CD Integration

The tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The workflow is configured to run the tests automatically on every push to the `main` branch and on pull requests. The test results are uploaded as artifacts for further inspection.

### Example Test

Here is an example of a Cypress test for the quiz component:

```javascript
describe('Quiz Component', () => {
  it('should start the quiz and display the first question', () => {
    cy.visit('/');
    cy.get('button').contains('Start Quiz').click();
    cy.get('.card').should('be.visible');
    cy.get('h2').should('not.be.empty');
  });

  it('should answer questions and complete the quiz', () => {
    cy.visit('/');
    cy.get('button').contains('Start Quiz').click();
    cy.get('button').contains('1').click();
    cy.get('.alert-success').should('be.visible').and('contain', 'Your score');
  });

  it('should restart the quiz after completion', () => {
    cy.visit('/');
    cy.get('button').contains('Start Quiz').click();
    cy.get('button').contains('1').click();
    cy.get('button').contains('Take New Quiz').click();
    cy.get('.card').should('be.visible');
    cy.get('h2').should('not.be.empty');
  });
});
```

These tests ensure that the quiz component behaves as expected, allowing users to start the quiz, answer questions, view their scores, and restart the quiz.
